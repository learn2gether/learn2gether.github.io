# Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify"> Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measurement of demand for products reflecting economic status in a country, and gross state product (GSP) represents the state economy. We can consider GSP as a representation measured by a sample data, which could also reflect the national economy. Thus, GDP and GSP usually are positively correlated. State final demand (SFD) is another measurement of the economy for state, and it has four components including household consumption, government consumption, private capital formation and public capital formation. SFD is different from GSP as GSP has two more components which are changes in inventories and export and import trading. Ultimately, SFD for each state is going to affect Australian domestic final demand. Household final consumption expenditure is driven by the consumption of electricity, fuel, food, clothing, recreation and so on. The private capital formation is driven by private investment such as the housing market, and the public investment is driven by the state and local governments. In short, final state demand is an indicator of economic activities reflecting the total consumption of an economy in goods and services that do not include international and interstate trade. SFD is important for managing the state economy as it measures whether each state can maintain a balance between aggregate supply and demand. The demand in economic growth usually has a significant increase, and it reflects the fluctuation on the economy. </div>
