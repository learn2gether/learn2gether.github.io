# Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify"> Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measurement of demand for products reflecting economic status in a country, and gross state product (GSP) represents the state economy. We can consider GSP as a representation measured by a sample data, which could also reflect the national economy. Thus, GDP and GSP usually are positively correlated. State final demand (SFD) is another measurement of the economy for state, and it has four components including household consumption, government consumption, private capital formation and public capital formation. SFD is different from GSP as GSP has two more components which are changes in inventories and export and import trading. Ultimately, SFD for each state is going to affect Australian domestic final demand. Household final consumption expenditure is driven by the consumption of electricity, fuel, food, clothing, recreation and so on. The private capital formation is driven by private investment such as the housing market, and the public investment is driven by the state and local governments. In short, final state demand is an indicator of economic activities reflecting the total consumption of an economy in goods and services that do not include international and interstate trade. SFD is important for managing the state economy as it measures whether each state can maintain a balance between aggregate supply and demand. The demand in economic growth usually has a significant increase, and it reflects the fluctuation on the economy. </div>

# SDF Data Exploration

<div style="text-align: justify"> There are three types of SFD data series including original data, trend estimates and seasonal adjustment. Original data (Abs.gov.au, 2012) reflects all patterns of time series, and it is suitable for analysis and forecasting based on historical data. Seasonal adjustment (Abs.gov.au, 2012) is a process of removing seasonal influences from the original time series, and the reason is to reveal the characteristics of quarterly or monthly sequences. There are some drawbacks of seasonal adjustment. At first, the adjusted time series are the result of the analysis, and we may not observe directly. Also, the original time series are independent of each other. The seasonal characteristics of adjusted time series change becoming interrelated. Trend adjustment (Abs.gov.au, 2012) is a process of smoothing noise from seasonally adjusted sequences. Thus, trend estimates have similar drawbacks with seasonal adjustment. In short, we are going to use original estimates for forecasting in this article. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The original estimates are measured by chain volume measures. Chain volume measures (Aph.gov.au, n.d.) is based on the weight of the price index of the previous financial year. Chain volume measures can reflect the current economic status by rebasing price index every year, thereby providing better estimates, especially in times of accelerated product upgrading. For example, high-tech products like computers, electronic products and mobile phones have a relatively short period of products iteration. Thus, the price of these products changes rapidly. </div>

# Model Selection
## ARIMA model

<div style="text-align: justify"> ARIMA model consists of autoregressive model, integration and moving average model. Autoregressive model only depends on its previous lagged value without any other explanatory variables. Integration meaning that the time series is differentiated through the model. Time series analysis requires stationary sequences, and we need to convert the unstable sequence into a stationary sequence by differential. As for the moving average model, and the value of a certain time point is affected by the prediction error in the past. The prediction error is the difference between the prediction and the true value. In short, ARIMA model only requires an endogenous variable without other exogenous variables. In our case, the input variable is only SFD itself. The SFD normally grows steadily over time, so its time series is non-stationary. </div>

<br />

## VAR model

<div style="text-align: justify"> VAR represents the vector  utoregression model, and it is applied to forecast time series which are interconnected to each other. The VAR model is built by considering all other endogenous variables as the hysteresis of one variable. Thus, VAR model is a multivariate autoregressive model, and it consists of multiple time series. If multiple non-stationary time series have a linear combination, this combination may be stationary. Also, if such a linear combination exists, these time series are cointegrated, which is able to interpret a long-term equilibrium relationship between these factors. In our case, the SFD consist of four components, and the input can be multiple time series. </div>
