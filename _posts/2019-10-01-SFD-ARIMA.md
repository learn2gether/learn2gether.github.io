# ARIMA Model

<div style="text-align: justify"> There are normally three steps to build ARIMA model including model identification and order determination, parameter estimation and model evaluation. </div>

## Model Identification And Order Determination

<div style="text-align: justify"> First, we find out the value of p, q and d. According to our previous analysis, we know that our time series become stationary after second difference. Thus, the value of d is 2. P and q can be determined by partial autocorrelation function (PACF) and autocorrelation function (ACF) respectively. According to the following figure, ACF decays to zero asymptotically, and PACF becomes zero abruptly after lag order of 3. Thus, AR(3) is probably a good choice. </div>

<br />

```python
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_pacf
plt.figure(figsize=(12,9))
plt.subplot(211)
plot_acf(wa_arima, ax=plt.gca())
plt.subplot(212)
plot_pacf(wa_arima, ax=plt.gca())
plt.show()
```

<br />

## Parameter Estimation

<div style="text-align: justify"> In order to select proper parameters, we can compare different combination of p, d, q parameters to select the best model with the least AIC and BIC. According to the following figure, the best model is ARIMA(3,2,3). </div>

<br />

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA
import pmdarima as pm

model = pm.auto_arima(wa_arima_train, start_p=1, start_q=1,
                      test='adf',       # use adftest to find optimal 'd'
                      max_p=5, max_q=10, # maximum p and q
                      m=1,              # frequency of series
                      d=None,           # let model determine 'd'
                      seasonal=False,   # No Seasonality
                      start_P=0, 
                      D=0, 
                      trace=True,
                      error_action='ignore',  
                      suppress_warnings=True, 
                      stepwise=True)

print(model.summary())
```

<br />

## Model Evaluation

<div style="text-align: justify"> We can review the residual to see whether our model is able to explain all patterns. According to the following figure, the residual errors moves around zero. The density plot shows a normal distribution. Also, almost all points fall in the red line, and the distribution is not skewed. Furthermore, ACF plot does not show any pattern in the residual errors meaning that there is no autocorrelation for the residual errors. Thus, the model is a good fit, and it is ready for forecasting. </div>

<br />

## Forecasts

<div style="text-align: justify"> Figure 28 shows the comparison between forecasts and actual values of SFD for WA. ARIMA seems to perform better than VAR model as forecasts are fairly closed to the actual value. Figure 29, Figure 39 and Figure 31 shows the comparison of other states. </div>

# Evaluate the Forecasts

<div style="text-align: justify"> In order to select a better model between VAR model and ARIMA model, I am going to compare their performance. There are several metrics such as ME, RMSE, minmax and so on. In our case, we use RMSE (root mean squared error). According to Figure 32 and Figure 33, ARIMA model perform better on predicting SFD of WA. However, VAR model has a relatively stable performance on each state. Therefore, VAR model is a better choice for forecasting SFD. </div>

# Forecasting the following quarters

<div style="text-align: justify"> According to analysis above, we select VAR model as the final model. In this section, we use this model to forecast the following quarters after March of the 2019. Therefore, it is not necessary to split data into training set and testing set, and we build the model based on the whole dataset as training set. The following figures show the forecasts for each state. </div>

# Reflection

<div style="text-align: justify"> With WA’s economy lagging behind in recent years, the state is likely to be the worst in the country due to slowing growth. According to the analysis above, the private capital formation declined significantly, while the government consumption and public capital formation grew slowly. The household consumption is the main contribution of each state. The following figure shows the granger causality test for SFD of all states and Australian GDP. The null hypothesis of this test is that time series in the system do not influence each other. If the P-value is less than 0.05, there is a strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. We can see that only SFD of WA cannot influence the SFD of NSW. This result may reflect that the WA economy is not diversified compared to other states. As we all know, the WA economy is closely related to the mining industry. The mining industry directly affects the development of other industries in WA, which makes the WA economy independent. </div>

<br />

<div style="text-align: justify"> Furthermore, the following figure confirms that WA economy is independent as well. New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland seems share similar patterns, and the rest of states also share similar patterns except WA. We can also see that WA and QLD economy grew massively starting around 2004 as the mining industry is from bust to boom (Reserve Bank of Australia, 2011). </div>

<br />

<br />

<div style="text-align: justify"> According to the forecasting model of WA, the household’s consumption expenditure contributes the most to the economy. As the example of Melbourne and Sydney, the real estate industry rises rapidly in these two cities. One of the reasons is the population is growing very fast over the years. Overseas immigrants make the most significant contribution to population growth. Once the population base is enormous, the demand for housing and infrastructure is also high, which also drive private and public capital formation. Then, these factors help create more jobs, thereby decreasing the unemployment rate. Therefore, economic development is fundamentally dependent on population growth. The following figure presents the impulse response analysis, which reflects that government consumption and household’s consumption have the impact on SFD all the time. Thus, the government pay more attention to these two components in the long run. For example, the state government should make policy about attracting more permanent population, which could make household’s consumption a sustained and steady effect on SFD. From this figure, we can conclude that the private and public capital formation have an impact on SFD in the short-term. Thus, the state government should adjust them frequently according to economic status. According to the next figure, FEVD is able to further evaluate how important of each structural shock by analyzing their contribution to SFD, which also confirms that the private and public capital formation influence SFD in the short-term, and the government and household consumption influence SFD in the long-term.
